Open your command prompt (Windows)/ terminal (macOS/ Linux). To check Python is installed, enter the following command:

python -V
# Or you might have the py command available,
# in which case try py -V
This should return a version number. If this is OK, navigate to the directory that your example is inside, using the cd command.

# include the directory name to enter it, for example
cd Desktop
# use two dots to jump up one directory level if you need to
cd ..
Enter the command to start up the server in that directory:

# If Python version returned above is 3.X
python3 -m http.server
# On windows try "python" instead of "python3", or "py -3"
# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL localhost:8000 in your web browser.
